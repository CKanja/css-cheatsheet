        <strong>Cascading Style Sheet</strong> or CSS is a stylesheet language that dictates how your website elements should look like. You can control the design, layout, font, and the color of your website content by embedding a CSS file into your HTML document. <br><br>

          CSS is a language for designing your website, which you can use to add background, colors, and even transitions or other interactive elements. It will also help you create a lightweight and responsive website that is SEO-friendly.

            Anatomy of a CSS ruleset
          </h1>

          <p>The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:<br><br>

<strong>Selector:</strong><br>
This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, elements). To style a different element, change the selector.<br><br>

<strong>Declaration:</strong><br>
This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.<br><br>

<strong>Properties:</strong><br>
These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.<br><br>

<strong>Property value:</strong><br>
To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)<br><br>

Note the other important parts of the syntax: <p><ul>

<li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
<li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
<li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one. </li></ul>

</p></ul>
